If I ask you one question:

If you were to keep one thing thats most important, what would that be - it would be data right


# How to think in data

If you look at any Software - it can be brown down into two categories: Code and Data. Code represents is the core business logic - the code that lives in your github repository - the one that you get to work with and interact with - add new features or metting some client requirement.


Both data and code have many things in similarity:
- both grow over time

Its important to make this distinction between code and data since data is way more important. IF you lose your code, you can still implement by backward engineering. But if you lose data - good luck getting it back. Thats why its such a big deal if someone says "I accidently dropped all prod data"... if you delete your codebase you can always get it from github. But if you lose your data then its hard to get it back...

atleast if you chose traditional form of data storage like postgres which implements Update in place techniques.... but lets not deviate from our main topic: Data vs Code


When we think only in data and how data flow, we can make sense of the architecture of the application
