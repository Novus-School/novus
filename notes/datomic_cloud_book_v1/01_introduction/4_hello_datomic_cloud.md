# Hello Datomic Cloud

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:
1. create your own basic clojure deps.edn datomic skeleton app - [FURTURE WORK - cli generator tool nx + datomic plugin?]
2. integrate a simple REPL development workflow which leads to my favourite part
3. learn about "flow" and flow driven development


## Part A - basic `deps.edn` project + REPL Driven Development 101
#### Goals:
After this lesson you will be able to:
- Creating a simple `deps.edn` project
- Understand the different properties of `deps.edn` configuration file
- Learn how to start a socket REPL using the -A command
- Learn how to connect to socket REPL
- Learn how to effectively use chlorine

### Step 1: Create a new directory

First, we are going to create a new directory called `novus`. This is where the application code will live

```
mkdir novus
```

### Step 2: Configure deps.edn

Next lets cd into the directory and add `deps.edn` file.

```clj
;; deps.edn
{}
```

**Question: What goes inside `deps.edn`?**
A config map containing the following keys:
1. `:paths`: this optional property specifies the location path of our source code. Note: By default, the `clj` tool will look for source files in the `src` directory. You must specify the paths manually to override the default behaviour
2. `:deps` - map of dependencies
3. `:aliases` - custom aliases

For now lets start by adding our first dependency: clojure

```
{:deps    {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}}
```

### Step 3: Add REPL

Next, we will need to configure socket REPL so that we can connect to our running app from the IDE. We can use aliases feature of deps.edn for that.

Lets add our first alias `:nrepl`.

```
{:deps    ...
 :aliases {:nrepl {:jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.server.repl={:port 7777 :accept clojure.core.server/repl}"]}}}
```
Now if we run `clj -A:nrepl`, it should start a network REPL on port `7777`

### Step 4: Add `src` directory
Next we will create `src` directory and create our root namespace i.e `novus`

```
mkdir src
mkdir src/novus
```

Inside `novus`, we will create a single file called `server.clj`
```
touch src/novus/server.clj
```

### Step 5: Modify `deps.edn` to add paths

```clj
{:paths ["src/main"]
 :deps    ...
 :aliases ...}

```

Since we have overwitten the default path, we will need to also move novus into `main` directory
```
mkdir src/main
mv src/novus src/main
```

### Step 6: Write simple hello world

```clj
(ns novus.server)

(defn -main []
  (println "Hello Novus"))
```

### Step 7: Connect IDE to REPL
Start the REPL by running the following

```
clj -A:nrepl
```
This should start a network REPL on port `7777`. (We will improve this in future) Now can connect to our application from the IDE. I am using chlorine plugin in atom IDE to connected to nREPL.


### Step 8: Add datomic dev-local dependency


Lets add our second alias `:dev`.


```
{:deps
 {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
  ...
 :aliases

 {:dev {:extra-paths ["src/dev"]
        :extra-deps {com.datomic/dev-local {:mvn/version "1.0.242"}}}
  ;; Allow novus to accept external REPL clients via a local connection to port 7777.
  :repl {:jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.server.repl={:port 7777 :accept clojure.core.server/repl}"]}}}

```

- We have added our second alias called `:dev` and have specified two properties `:extra-paths` of "src/dev" and a single `:extda-deps` extra dependency - the datomic/dev-local library version "1.0.242" in this case (March 1st, 2022)

In order to load `:dev` alias we have to restart our repl. Lets do that

```
clj -A:dev:repl
```

This will ensure three things:

1. We can invoke expressions inside `user.clj` file. `development`
2. Download `datomic/dev-local` library - which means we can finally start writing our app
3. Start a network REPL on port `7777`

Next lets create the `dev` directory and create `user.clj` file.

```
mkdir src/dev
touch src/dev/user.clj
```

### Step 9: Require dev-local library

```clj
(ns user
  (:require [datomic.client.api :as d]))

;;
(comment
  "3 Database API's"
  (d/delete-database (d/client {:server-type :dev-local
                                :system "dev"})
                     {:db-name "random"})
  (d/list-databases (d/client {:server-type :dev-local
                                :system "dev"})
                    {})
  (d/create-database (d/client {:server-type :dev-local
                                :system "dev"})
                     {:db-name "random"}))
```

### Step 10: Our first datomic function - `create-database`

Creating a datomic database is a two step process

1. create a datomic

*Q: How do you create a datomic client*

Datomic has a `client` function. We need provide a map containing two things
 - `:server-type`
 - `:system`

Lets create an example client called `novus-client`

```clj
(def novus-client (d/client {:server-type :dev-local
                             :system "dev"}))
```

Now that we have our client, we can create our first database called "novus". We can create a new database using
`create-database`

`create-database` function takes two arguments
 - a datomic `client`
 - a map containing database name (`:db-name`)


```clj
(def db-name {:db-name "novus"})
(def (d/create-database novus-client db-name))
```

Next let's create a datomic connection. We need to create datomic connection because without connection we wont be able to do anything.

We can create a connection using the `connect` function. This function accepts a datomic client and a map containing :db--

```
(def {:db-name "novus"})

(def conn (d/connect client db-name)]
```

### Step 11: Create and transact datomic schema

In a relational database, you must specify a table schema that enumerates in advance the attributes (columns) an entity can have. By contrast, Datomic requires only that you specify the properties of individual attributes. Any entity can then have any attribute. Because all datoms are part of a single relation, this is called a universal schema.

Each Datomic database has a schema that describes the set and kind of attributes that can be associated with your domain entities.

A schema only defines the characteristics of the attributes themselves. It does not define which attributes can be associated with which entities. Decisions about which attributes apply to which entities are made by your application.

This gives applications a great degree of freedom to evolve over time. For example, an application that wants to model a person as an entity does not have to decide up front whether the person is an employee or a customer. It can associate a combination of attributes describing customers and attributes describing employees with the same entity. An application can determine whether an entity represents a particular abstraction, customer or employee, simply by looking for the presence of the appropriate attributes.

There are two kinds of attributes in Datomic:

Domain attributes - describe aspects of your domain data. You use domain attributes to describe the data about your domain entities.
Schema attributes - describe aspects of the schema itself. Schema attributes are built-in and cannot be extended. You use schema attributes to define your domain attributes.
For more information see the [schema documentation](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/schema/schema-reference.html).


For our case, let start with modelling the student. To keep it simple we will define only 4 attributes:
- ID
- first name
- last name
- school


```clj
(def novus-schema
  [{:db/ident :student/id
    :db/doc "The id of the account"
    :db/unique :db.unique/identity
    :db/valueType :db.type/uuid
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}

   {:db/ident :student/first-name
    :db/doc "The first name of the account"
    :db/valueType :db.type/string
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}

   {:db/ident :student/last-name
    :db/doc "The last name of the account"
    :db/valueType :db.type/string
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}

   {:db/ident :student/school
    :db/doc "School of the student"
    :db/valueType :db.type/ref
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}])
```

Now that we have defined our schema, lets transact it using the `transact` function. This function accepts two argument: `conn` and map containing :tx-data - value must be the schema.

Keep in mind that Datomic uses the same function to transact core data. Meaning schema is added the same manner as any other data, keeping the API simple.


```clj
(d/transact conn {:tx-data schema})
```

### Step 12: Transact mock students
```clj
(def mock-data (-> "src/resources/seed.edn" slurp edn/read-string))

(d/transact conn {:tx-data mock-data})
```

Notice the api for transacting data is the same as schema leading to code api consistency


### Step 13: Query

To query a database, you must first obtain a `connection` and a `database value`. The example below shows a simple query using the Synchronous API. This query fetches all the students.

`datomic.client.ap/q` is the primary entry point for Datomic query.

`q` Performs the query described by query and args, and returns a collection of tuples.

 - :query - The query to perform: a map, list, or string. Complete description.
  - :find - specifies the tuples to be returned.
  - :with - is optional, and names vars to be kept in the aggregation set but not returned
  - :in - is optional. Omitting ':in â€¦' is the same as specifying ':in $'
  - :where - limits the result returned
 - :args - Data sources for the query, e.g. database values retrieved from a call to db, and/or rules.


#### Query 1: Give me list of all the students

```
;; get db value
(def db (d/db conn))

;; query
(d/q '[:find (pull ?student [*])
       :where [?student :student/id]]
      db)

;; returns
[[{:db/id 87960930222227,
   :student/id #uuid "0515a5fa-f177-44f0-8144-d6bdcc403564",
   :student/first-name "Lynn",
   :student/last-name "Margulis"}
 [{:db/id 87960930222228,
   :student/id #uuid "1c1bae77-13fa-4cd1-b595-6c86fdd55946",
   :student/first-name "Galileo",
   :student/last-name "Galilei"}]]

```


#### Query 2: Give me count of all the students
```
(d/q '[:find (count ?student)
       :where [?student :student/id]]
  (d/db (:conn db))))

;; return [[2]]
```
