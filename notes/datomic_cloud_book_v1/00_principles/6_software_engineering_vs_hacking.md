# 5 Kinds of Thinking and Knowledge - Alan Kay

## Example 1: Tinkering a Bridge
### Level 1 Knowledge: Tinkering a Bridge

To understand the five different kinds of thinking and knowledge, let's say that theres a big body of water and of course want to cross it. Historically the way things started was somebody would tinker something - in this case is a rope bridge. This is one kind kind of knowledge and we share tinkering with all primates and most mammals.

Tinkering does not guarantee 100 success. Its mostly trail and error. The risk is high but the opportunity to learn is greater as well. Over time we aggregate all the positive aspects of tinkering, which leads to second or level 2 knowledge

### Level 2 Knowledge: Liking what we tinker

The second kind of knowledge we have is liking what we tinker or not...

### Level 3 Knowledge: Principled building of a bridge

...and often that will lead us to be much more careful about - thinking about building something or cooking a meal.

And engineering got started really early because it didn't have to know WHY things worked. It just had to find out WHAT worked. In the old days you would gather a cookbook, whether its for bridge or for a meal.

### Level 4 Knowledge: Represent and Reason about "bridges"

People soon started realizing that you could do a lot of work with "symbols" and this is one of the biggest drivers for mathematics that we know today. Models are cheaper to create than actually building the thing.

### Level 5 Knowledge: Theories of "Bridges"

Then only a few hundred years ago we get science. Science is a very different kind of way of looking at things. It gives us a theory and in this case it's a theory of an artifact, a theory of a bridge because science doesn't care where the phenomena come from.

Science is about finding the relationship between noisy phenomena and our noisy representations

So five kinds of thinking and knowledge. This is their historical order and now if we come and look at the Akashi Strait here. How big is this strait? Well, here's the empire state building and the great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt and oh yeah we can get across that.

This is the largest suspension bridge in the world. it required a combination of getting the science done, feeding the science back into engineering using models and making a wonderful synthesis of these main disciplines that is why its really our greatest luck to be born into this time of science and engineering and mathematics working together


### Example 2: Flight

Well here is another dream about water - this time about flight - daedalus and icarus

Leonardo took a shot at it but again he had engine problems. People tried to do man powered flight.

Henry Kremer, a British Industrialist put up big money -  about $700 to $800 today, the first real man powered flight and they kept on crashing the planes.

After some decades of this uh the guy who was the first soaring champion and an aeronautical engineer, Paul MacCready,
was trying to figure out how to pay off a debt his brother in law had incurred and that morning he had noticed that the exchange rate made the Kramer prize for manpower flight exactly the debt his brother in law had incurred and started thinking about and his main thought was  well the best people in the world like he knew a lot of the people who were doing this, the best people in the world have been working this for decades and they haven't had anything close to his success. What is the problem? and he said "Well the problem is we don't understand the problem" - so he abandoned thinking about human-powered flight and asked what is a better problem and he went back to his group in simi california and said "look, forget about human-powered flight... lets just make something that can be repaired so quickly that we can handle 10 crashes a day, something is just made out of really scotch tape and some mylar and some aluminium structs"...

Six weeks they had had more flights and more crashes than everybody else in history put together and in six months they won the Kramer Prize and a few months later they won even the larger Kramer prize which is a flight across the english channel - about 22 miles.

And the British press interviewed MacCready and asked "well how could you do this so easily when everybody else was struggling for decades" and he said "well, they were trying to build an airplane, we were trying to do human-powered flight" in other words having an air plane as a goal was actually counterproductive because these ultralight planes with these huge wings and huge difficulty in turning, they weren't really like an airplane.
