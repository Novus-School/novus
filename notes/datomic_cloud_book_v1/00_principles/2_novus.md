<!-- Let me tell you a story about our education system. Ready... -->

## Principles

- No classes - No grouping of students by age
    rationale: This is an outdated approach
- Exploratory Learning
    rationale:
- Adventure Based Learning Games
- Ask questions -> AI responds with appropriate response based on context
  rationale: We gain better context of the problem domain by making asking questions, making mistakes, thinking differently, taking new routes etc - students in novus are encouraged to question everything that surrounds them - because when you ask questions you are intentionally or unintentionally challenging the status quo
- Encourage team work, team building, communication among learners
- Learn anything:
  - Mycology, Astronomy or History of Lisp
  - Game based
  - Mastery based
