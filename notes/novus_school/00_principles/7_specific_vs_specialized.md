# Specialized vs Specific Knowledge

Any one can memorize different diseases and disorders that’s specialized knowledge
What’s unique about Dr. House is his knack understanding for human behaviour.
His experience taught him that everyone lies.
His compulsion to solve puzzles and explain the world and his comfort with taking risks to do so
Now that’s specific knowledge

And why does it matter so much?
Naval argues that the internet has  massively broadened the possible space of careers. It enables any niche interest as long as you are the best person at it to scale it out


So how do we help kids find and develop their specific knowledge?
Like many other important things, specific knowledge can’t be taught in school. Its found  by pursing your genuine interests and innate talents and parents can play a big role in

Foundation
1. General Knowledge about how to learn how the world works and
2. How to solve problems

In other words the need “range”. A concept developed by David Epstein

In addition to having a range of general knowledge kids lots of room to play around, explore their interests and dive deep into whatever you like

Make sure you give them space and encouragement  to get lost into what interest them.

Point out what they and they alone can offer the world.

Help them understand how their unique skills, traits and interests can help others and talk about how they can apply their specific knowledge to real changing problems

Two important things to keep In mind. First we can’t force kids to develop specific knowledge. We can only encourage them. It has to feel like play

And second specific knowledge isn’t about creating child prodigies or specializing in technical knowledge from a young age. Its about helping kids discover their tendencies, gifts and skills and allowing space for them to have fun stretching their unique muscles
