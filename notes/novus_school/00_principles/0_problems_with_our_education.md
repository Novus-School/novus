# Problems with our Current Education System

Problems
- based on very old ideas (1000 years) - it used to make sense at some point - now it does more harm than good
- time based
- factory school system
- punishes for being curious, asking questions
- rewards obedience
- old and oudated learning materials
- focus on marks and exams
- punishes failures
- no focus on mental health
- uses bell curve method to determine who passes/fails the course



## Mental Models

## 1. Factory Based Educational Model - launchschool ✍ Chris Lee


origin: 1000 years ago

- caters to performance oriented goals
- goals are short term, has a definite fixed end
- the oldest and most common educational model

We call this the factory model because, in a sense, this model puts students on a conveyor belt and moves them along from one topic to the next with complete disregard for comprehension or mastery. It's pretty common for people to pass a class even after receiving a C grade, and these students rarely catch up, especially when concepts are cumulative, like math or science.

The factory model's main concern is time and not comprehension: you learn for a fixed amount of time, and then you move on regardless of the level of comprehension. However, it's not just the lack of time that's the problem in factory-based education. Since mastery of knowledge is not the focus, curriculum designers of factory-based education aim to produce a bell curve of students' comprehension distribution. In a time-based course, curriculum designers measure their own success not by trying to increase students' mastery of the material, but by how closely the students' comprehension distribution fits the bell curve. This almost means that the curriculum by design ensures that most students do not reach an A+ level of mastery. According to the factory-model of education, mastery is only reserved for the top few.

Let’s look at how this model manifests itself in the learn-to-code industry. The following image contains a selection of blurbs from websites of various coding boot-camps.
