# Clojure

This page provides an overview of the material for the first module of the course including topics, learning goals, estimate of time required and study tips. Each module of the course will start with a similar page which you can always access from the navigation bar to the left.

In this course we use a programming language called Clojure. Clojure is small and simple, and you will be able to learn most of it in this first module. Its simplicity has two benefits. First it allows us to spend more time on learning the design method which is the real focus of the course. In addition, because Clojure forms the core of nearly every other language you will ever use, learning the design method using BSL will help you adapt the material you learn in this course to other programming languages.

This course is primarily targeted at students who have never programmed before, so for many of you this will be your first programming language. The videos in this module are paced with that in mind. The videos go through not just the language but also the tools we will be using. Please avoid the temptation to skim this material.

For students who have already programmed, this module may seem too easy â€“ but be careful! Be sure to learn this programming language. While this language forms the conceptual core of nearly every programming language you might have used, it is also different in important ways. Take the time to go through this material carefully.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 5-8 hours of dedicated time to complete.

Learning Goals
Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans.
Be able to write constant and function definitions.
Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls.
Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression.
Be able to use the Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.
