Discussion board etiquette
The discussion forum is the place to ask questions, answer questions, and exchange ideas with the other participants in this course. Please contribute your thoughts and questions! While the discussion forum offers great possibility, it can also be abused. All participants must be respectful, tactful, and open-minded in these forums.

Finding Your Way Around the Discussion Board
Discussion topics are created by the course team and organize all posts in the course discussion. Discussion topics can be course-wide or content-specific:

Course-wide discussion topics cover matters that affect the entire course, and include topics such as “General Topics” and “Technical Questions”. In the discussion navigation pane, course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them.
Content-specific discussion topics are added as part of a course unit, and relate to specific video lectures, reading assignments, homework problems, or other course content. These are seeded within the courseware itself
In the discussion navigation pane on the Discussion page, content-specific topics are indented under an identifying category name. For course-wide topics, you read or add posts, responses, and comments on the Discussion page. For content-specific discussion topics, you can read or add posts, responses, and comments both on the Discussion page and in the discussion that is embedded in the course unit on the Course page. Before you add a post, remember to classify it as either a Question or a Discussion. You should then look through the topics to determine where your post would best fit. When you add your post to the most appropriate topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and respond to it more easily.
