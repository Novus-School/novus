Hi Vishal,
I hope this message finds you well.
I got your CV from Houman and he told me about your interest in Sofdesk.
I understood that an interview should happen before Wednesday. Are you available Tuesday for 1 hour between 12pm and 3pm?

I've also invited you to our technical test in the meantime. We usually send it after the in-person interview, but since we are limited in time, you may want to do it beforehand. It usually takes 1-2h.

Hope to see you soon,
Maxime
CTO @ Sofdesk
