## Chapter 0: The Prepration

In this chapter I want to share how I got started with Software Development.

So as you can see, in the beginning I had 0 context about what Software Development actually is. I was only focusing on the coding / technical aspect. Second I was stuck in tutorial hell. Most of the content taught in the tutorial was taken straight from the documentation. Another problem with this approach is that I was simply copying the solution thought by someone else - a happy path approach to learning - which i have painfully learned that in real world - we have to take consideration of all the factors - not just the happy path

Another problem with these courses is that they only focus on building a small prototype. And once the tutorial is finished, you stop working on the prototype. In real world is like a never ending group project - people only stop working on software if a. they quit b. the company goes bankrupt

When learning to code, you typically learn alone and write code alone. There is no one to review your code, so you dont get the same feed back - this is very crucial because feed back provides an oppoortunity for you to improve your solution and grow as a programmer - which something I personally didn't have when learning to code.

In Real world - software development is a social activity where business analysts, sales, product owner, product designer, software engineer all collaborate together to solve core business problems. 

Finally I was only focusing on writing code and not on reading code. Generally speaking we can read faster than we can write. Wrtiing requires lots of time and careful thinking. Where as reading requires - well the content is there you just have to comprehend what you are reading - which is much easier than writing.

One big lession I have learned over the years - especially after working in large code base is this: You an learn a lot just by reading/studying other people code. Learning to read/study other people code you will learn:

- How certain concepts are applied in real life
- Learn how professionals code
- Learn from other peoples writing style
- Learn differnt patterns, techniques to solve specific problems

Learning to read/study code is fanstastic but I would like to remind you again: humans are not perfect -> humans write code

In real life code base is full of technical debts. There are always some things that can be improved.

### Part 2 - Montreal - Dedode MTL
Time: Jan 2016 - April, 2018
Coding Bootcamp

- I had a very positve Bootcamp experience
- I got to work with other people and work on projects as a team
- I had tutors who where reviewing my code to see if I was doing everything right
