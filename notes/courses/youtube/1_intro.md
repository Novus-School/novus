   - "Important thing about Xerox Parc, which is not emphasized enough is that PARC was just another
      one of the ARPA Research Project (but funded by Xerox). ARPA research started in 1962 - there was 8 years of research before PARC happened. And PARC only happened because of the Vietnam war, nobody wanted to try to do this stuff inside of a company - the company quarterly cycles and everything else are really antithetical to long range thinking. So this stuff was all funded by cold war funds in the public domain. So none of the IP was kept secret, but it was done in a better rythim. So to get the 35 trillion it actually required not five years but 12 to 14 years. We were the lucky researchers who got our PHDs in this process and we're on the right age to go to PARC and finished it off. Right as will see, I am not going to dwell on it much more"

And the most important thing - and this is a dumb sentence because you dont know what these machines were like. So I realised after I put this in there - why did I even put this in, right?.. But the way I look at what's going on at any given time, whether its today, 30 or 40 years ago - is whatever is going on right now is just crap, by definition"
