## Thinking in data

If you go to your browser and type `www.duolingo.com` -> and assuming you have a an account, it redirects to `www.duolingo.com/learn`. In my case I am currently learning `french`

Now if you focus on this ui alone, there is a lot of things happening here:
- on the top we have a nav-bar containing the following links
  - Learn, Stories, Discuss, Shop and More. Each link has an icon [`q: where is this icon coming from?`]
- After "More" button comes the language learning dropdown containing list of countries flags - mine shows a french flag (I am learning french). If I click on the button, it should display the list of all the languages I am currently learning
- Crown Icon
- Streak Icon
- Lingots Icon
- Finally an icon cotaining your profile picture. Hovering over it opens a dropdown contaning two things
 - notifications
 - account settings links such as "Your Profile", "Settings", "Help", "Logout" etc
